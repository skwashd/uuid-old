Generate Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) for Drupal objects.

Current features include:

    * Automatic UUID generation/loading/deleting for nodes, node revisions, 
      users and taxonomy.
    * Allow choosing which content types and vocabularies to create UUIDs for.
    * Option to batch create UUIDs for objects which don't have it already.

You should only install this module if other module advised you to do so, or 
if you plan to use UUIDs on your site, with custom code.
